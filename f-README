Generic Config And Compiling Guide for f-scripts written in C

Substitute f-script with the one you are installing.
(Yes, "script" isn't really the correct word for something written in C)

Every f-script written in C has a config.h-sample included. It must be copied
to config.h and edited appropriately. This config file is a C-include file and
therefore has C-syntax (Don't be alarmed if you dont know C, common-sense will
suffice). All options in config.h are documented there and have reasonable
defaults, but be warned that no script will run out-of-the-box.

To compile a script use
# make

and if no compile error are shown use
# make install
to install it into the default place in /glftpd/bin.

f-scripts usually do _not_ have external config files that are read on
script-execution. There are no f-script.confs in /glftpd/bin. All config info
is compiled into the binary. Therefore if a setting in config.h needs
adjustment, you have to repeat the install steps. This usually means to "make
install" after changing config.h.

With zipscript-c I always have the problem of losing the zsconfig.h, so the
config.h of f-scripts are saved inside the binary itself. It can be retrieved
with "./f-script dumpconfig" when needed.

Have Fun
